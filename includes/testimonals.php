                        <p>The hospital is close to my house so it is easy to have my doctors refer me there for tests such as skin care work or medical imaging. That is the blessing of having a community hospital. </p>

                        <p>The hospital communicated results and status updates to my other doctors.I told my specialist I received perfect care. My specialist was amazed with my strength and highly approved of my therapy. </p>

                        <p>I have never experienced such care. It’s nice to live in a small town and have super healthcare available. When you get old, all you need is someone to care like they do. We are very lucky, </p>

                        <p>It was the happiest place. Everyone talked to me. When anyone walked into my room they would ask me how I’m doing. They really treated me like family. I was blessed with a wonderful roommate.</p>
